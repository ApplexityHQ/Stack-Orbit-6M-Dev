/* 
================ Variables ============
    - Named storage location whose values can be manupulated during execution of the program.
    - How to make them ?
        -- use: var, let (can be reassigned) , const (can't be reassigned)
        -- randomGuy = "simpson"; ()
    - Note: In javascript, whenever it executes, all files gets combined to make a object called as "Window"
    - Window (object) is a Global Variable & Predifined
    - Local Scope (Function/Parent Scope) & Global Scope.
    - when we use 'let' & 'const' variables it creates a 'block level scope' (technically its not a scope)


================= Data Types ==========
    - Types : Primitives & Non-Primitives (Complex Primitives)
    
        - # Primitive
            -- undefined (default value)
            -- null (explicit value: sometimes treated as default value and sometimes as value)
            -- Number
            -- BigInt
            -- Symbol (a way to secure)
            -- String
            -- Boolean
        
        - # Complex Primitives
            -- Objects (stored in key value pair)
                -- objects works on refrences.
